# README

This is a simple project using Ruby to create an web app that would allow me to store or submit useful links that relate to coding.

Used the following:

* Devise - Flexible authentication solution for Rails with Warden

* Bootstrap Sass - is a Sass-powered version of Bootstrap 3, ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications.

* acts_as_votable - Rails gem to allowing records to be votable

* record_tag_helper - ActionView Record Tag Helpers

* simple_form - Forms made easy!
